[TEDxVITAP website](https://distracted-torvalds-73a25d.netlify.app/)

On the 10th of April 2021, VITAP held a TEDxVITAP event, which was named 
"The Unstoppables" . I was appointed as the website developer along with some 
other web developers. 

This website was built using React JS framework.

I would like to thank Sai Pranay, Vineet Tiwari, and SK Saddam Hossain, who 
were my teammates in this project.
Thank you guys.
