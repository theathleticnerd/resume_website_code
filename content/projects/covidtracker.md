[COVID-19 Tracker App](https://covidagain-b4d37.web.app/)

During the pandemic, the stats of the number of the corona virus
cases were everywhere. I thought it would be nice to create a web
application to track the number of active covid cases, the number of 
patients recovered from COVID and the number of deaths. It includes both 
daily statistics and all time statistics

The web application is built using React JS framework and an API to collect the
statistics to display the COVID-19 cases.
