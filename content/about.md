### `$whoami`

Hello, I'm Job and I build software.

I'm a student pursuing a Computer Science Major in [VIT-AP](https://vitap.ac.in/). 
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, meaning I work in both the front-end and the back-end of a web application.
I also like to do normal stuff on the terminal (makes me look cool) and rice linux desktops.

I have some projects on this website which might impress you.

Here's my [github page](https://github.com/theathleticnerd), where most of my work is avaliable.
I am a fan of Open Source Software.

Congratulations on finding my website BTW ^_^
